1: Tell Django that you should update the database to include the information about the models that i have
    just created.
    --> python manage.py makemigrations

2: Apply the migration to the Django database
    --> python manage.py migrate

3: Manipulate the data of the database:
    --> python manage.py shell

4: On the shell:
    from flights.models import Flights
    f = Flight(origin="New York", destination="London", duration="435")
    f.save()

    Flight.objects.all()

    After we define the function of __str__:
    flights = Flight.objects.all()
    flights
        --> New we can see the string representation defined before

    flight = flights.first()
    flight
    flight.in
    flight.origin
    flight.destination
    flight.duration

    Delete the flight:
    flight.delete()


5: After we make changes of our models:
    (1): python manage.py makemigrations
        --> Look for any changes that have been made to models.py and go ahead and create a migration 
            instruction for how to make those changes to our database 
    (2): python manage.py migrate

    (3): Back to shell
        from flights.models import *
        jfk = Airport(code="JFK", city="New York")
        jfk.save()
        lhr = Airport(code="LHR", city="London")
        lhr.save()
        cbd = Airport(code="CDG", city="Paris")
        cbd.save()
        nrt = Airport(code="NRT", city="Tokyo")
        nrt.save()
        
        f = Flight(origin=jfk, destination=lhr, duration=123)
        f.save()

        f
        f.origin
        f.origin.city
        f.origin.code
        lhr.arrivals.all()
